            <h3>Hindusatni Music:</h3>
            <p>Hindustani music originated in the Vedic period and is considered northern music. The musicians in the ancient days used to play Hindustani music as religious hymns. Earlier it was considered a part of Carnatic music. However, with the Persian influence in the 14th century, it stood up as a type of music on its own. Nowadays, Hindustani music is hugely represented in Bollywood and is more familiar to the western world.

            <h3>Bharatanatyam:</h3>
            <p>Bharatanatyam is a dance of Tamil Nadu in southern India. It traces its origins back to the Natyashastra, an ancient treatise on theatre written by the mythic priest Bharata. Originally a temple dance for women, bharatanatyam often is used to express Hindu religious stories and devotions. It was not commonly seen on the public stage until the 20th century. The dance movements are characterized by bent legs, while feet keep rhythm. Hands may be used in a series of mudras, or symbolic hand gestures, to tell a story.</p>
